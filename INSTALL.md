The tools' binaries have already been installed in a Docker container, and the evaluation stages have been documented in README.md. We expect that the reviewers will download and install the Docker application on their machines.The README.md file explains how to pull the Docker images. After pulling images from DockerHub, reviewers can check if the tools are functioning by following the steps in README.md. The expected outcomes are listed in the Observation sections of the README.md.
